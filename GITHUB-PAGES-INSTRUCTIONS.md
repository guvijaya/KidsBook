# GitHub Pages Setup Instructions

## ✅ Repository is Ready for GitHub Pages!

Your KidsBook repository is now properly structured with all website files at the root level. Follow these steps to enable GitHub Pages:

### 📋 Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Go to your repository**: https://github.com/guvijaya/KidsBook

2. **Access Settings**:
   - Click on the "Settings" tab (near the top right of your repository page)

3. **Navigate to Pages**:
   - Scroll down in the left sidebar
   - Click on "Pages" under "Code and automation"

4. **Configure Source**:
   - Under "Source", select "**Deploy from a branch**"
   - Under "Branch", select "**main**" 
   - Under "Folder", select "**/ (root)**" 
   - Click "**Save**"

5. **Wait for Deployment** (1-10 minutes):
   - GitHub will build and deploy your site
   - You'll see a green checkmark when ready

6. **Access Your Live Website**:
   - Your website will be available at: **https://guvijaya.github.io/KidsBook/**

### 🎯 Why This Works Now:

- ✅ `index.html` is at repository root (required for GitHub Pages)
- ✅ All assets (`css/`, `js/`, `images/`, `essays/`) are properly referenced
- ✅ Clean repository structure without nested directories
- ✅ All website functionality preserved (multilingual, pagination, responsive design)

### 🔧 File Structure (Root Level):
```
KidsBook/
├── index.html          # ← Main website file (required at root)
├── css/styles.css      # ← Styling
├── js/app.js          # ← Application logic  
├── js/github-content.js # ← Content management
├── essays/            # ← All stories (ta/, te/, en/, kn/, hi/)
├── images/            # ← Shared images
├── content/           # ← Original content files
└── README.md          # ← Documentation
```

### 🌐 After Setup:
- Your website will be live at: https://guvijaya.github.io/KidsBook/
- Changes pushed to main branch will auto-update the live site
- All 5 languages (Tamil, Telugu, English, Kannada, Hindi) will work
- Book-style pagination and responsive design will work perfectly

### 🚀 Next Steps:
1. Enable GitHub Pages following the steps above
2. Test your live website  
3. Share the URL with kids and families!
4. Add more stories by simply adding new `.md` files to the `essays/` folders
