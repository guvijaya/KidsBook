# Train Journey ðŸš‚

## The Joy of Train Travel

Train journeys are always very interesting. We can see everything through the windows while traveling. We can also walk inside the moving train, eat good food and snacks, play games and converse during our journey. Overall, it's an enjoyable experience.

## Seattle to Portland Adventure

I have traveled from Seattle to Portland. We arrived at the station on time, queued up, and had our tickets checked. The staff confirmed our coach and seats, collected our luggage, and checked them in. The ticket conductor's uniform was impressive. Once we completed the formalities, we boarded the train.

## Railway Station Atmosphere

Railway stations always have their own unique fragrance. It's fascinating to see the parallel tracks converge and diverge. I never tire of watching this. Seeing the graffiti on the walls along the way was new to me. When we passed through villages, children waved at us. I waved back, but I'm not sure if they saw us.

## Train Features

Our train had an observation and viewing car from where we could see all the scenic beauties. It was a new experience for me. Another coach had a snack bar where we could buy and eat food and drink warm tea or coffee.

At each station, they announced the station name and some information about the city. Passengers alighted and boarded the train at each station. Each station had a different look, which made it more interesting.

## Comparing Train Systems

I prefer traveling by trains in India more than in the USA. Many times, I have traveled on night trains where we can stretch out completely like a bed. The rhythmic movement of the train, the coooo coooo whistle, the noise of the old fan, and the overall train travel experience is mesmerizing.

Vendors sell food and drinks from inside the train while it's moving and also sell from each station through the windows.

## Thrilling Moments

The wind that slaps your face near the door while the train is speeding is a thrilling and scary experience. I know it is risky, but I stand near either my mom or dad. Trains that climb mountains, run alongside beaches, and go through tunnels give different experiences.

## Long-Distance Routes

There are trains from one coast to another in the USA, such as:
- Seattle to Los Angeles
- Chicago to Seattle
- San Francisco to Los Angeles
- Grand Canyon routes

These routes are full of scenic beauty and provide a memorable experience. Long-distance trains offer varied experiences.

## City Transportation

There are also many trains within the city, such as monorails and metro trains, which make commuting easy and faster. Monorails run on a single track and are mostly automatic, making continuous trips up and down.

They mostly ply on overhead tracks, and I have traveled by them to avoid city traffic. This helps daily commuters travel to their offices and schools at the right time, as it is faster and goes underground too. This is the best way to commute within the city.

I haven't observed much while traveling by this route because I'm usually looking out for my station to alight.

## Trams - A Different Experience

Trams are slower and move along with the cars and trucks on their own tracks. They have a bell and a few stops on their route. It is a funny experience, and I enjoyed my travel on trams too.
