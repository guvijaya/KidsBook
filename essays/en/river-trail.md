# Sammamish River Trail üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Getting Ready for Adventure

My father had bought me a co-pilot bike trailer, and we had ridden it a few times inside our gated community. I had been eagerly waiting for a long journey on it, and today was the day. We were going to ride our bikes around the Sammamish River Trail.

My dad and I got ready by putting on our cycling outfits and helmets and filling up our water bottles. My dad also brought some snacks for me. I was enthusiastic and excited about this trip.

## Starting Our Journey

Our journey began, and we had to travel alongside other speeding vehicles on the main road. Though my dad was riding, I was a little scared by the noise of the speed, but it was also thrilling. We reached Marymoor Park after crossing a small bridge and started riding along the banks of the Sammamish River.

## Beautiful River Views

The river was gushing, and there were many other riders and walkers like us. The road beside the river looked beautiful, and the river flowing alongside the road was exotic.

First, we stopped below a bridge where a few ducks were swimming. While we were watching them, a kid tried to feed them, and one of the ducks came out of the water to peck at the food before swimming back. It was so beautiful to see the ducks silently paddling their feet and swimming in the river.

## Traffic Above, Peace Below

Motor vehicles were speeding on the bridge while we were riding below it. Our route was along the banks of the river, and the river, bridge, vehicles, and us together created a pleasant experience. There were more bridges along the way, and we saw a senior living home with a pickleball court. I like this game very much, and I decided to find out if I could play there next time we visit.

## Riding with Dad

I was proud to go with my dad as a tandem rider, and we saw many different kinds of bicycles on the road. Some people rode fast, and some slow. Some people carried a child basket and took their kids along. When people overtook us, they announced that they were coming from the left or right.

## Natural Beauty

A chill breeze was caressing us, and the day was bright. We could see the long Cascadia Mountain range in the far distance, and Mount Rainier was visible from far away. This road started from Marymoor Park to Bothell, a distance of nearly 10 miles.

We saw some people skating along the road, a horse rider, and someone rowing a boat. We also passed a few parks, including a 60-acre park, which was enormous.

## Traffic-Free Roads

The road without vehicular traffic was awesome, and people and pets enjoying the free road was a nice experience. We reached Woodinville, and I became very tired. Although my dad pedaled, I had also co-pedaled, which was why I was tired.

I had some water and finished eating the snacks while taking some rest. We used the restroom there, too.

## Unexpected Rain

After resting for a while, we started our return journey, but then it got cloudy. My dad decided to reach home before the rain and started pedaling. It started drizzling, and then it started raining heavily.

Rain in Seattle is not new, but we didn't expect it to pour down like this. I got wet and started shivering, and I told my dad that I couldn't bear the cold. He told me that there was no shade to hide because the places were parks and open grounds.

He further said that we could manage and go in the rain, but I was fatigued and totally famished. My dad didn't know what to do.

## A Stranger's Kindness

Finally, we reached a neighborhood, and my dad went and asked a person who was walking for help. The person was a German guy, and he said his house was close by and took us there. We kept our cycle in his house and he dropped us off by his car at our house.

After sitting in the car, my shivering reduced. A stranger made me comfortable and saved me from the cold. When we reached home, Mom got anxious seeing the stranger. Dad went back with him and brought the cycle.

## An Adventurous Day

Our trip became an adventurous one. I decided that next time if I plan, I will check the temperature and dress up accordingly to protect myself from the cold wind and rain. Definitely, I would go on the Sammamish River Trail again.

Traveling on the traffic-free, beautiful road is an exciting experience.
