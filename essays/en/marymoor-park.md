# Marymoor Park üèûÔ∏è

## Childhood Memories

When I was five years old, I went to Marymoor Park and played on the slide. I enjoyed playing on the sit and spin and spent a long time on the swing. My dad was exercising with the equipment available, and there were high school students playing football/soccer. I think it was a tournament between schools.

There were also many tennis courts, and I fell in love with the park on my first visit.

## Returning to the Park

Today, I visited the park again with my dad on our bicycles. He promised to take me around the whole area, and we came via an iron bridge that was not our usual route. We stopped on the bridge and enjoyed the beauty of the river, watching a few birds.

As we crossed the bridge, we saw several baseball courts and a playground, but I didn't play today. I noticed that all six football courts had electric bulbs fitted.

## Garden Memories

I remembered my mom telling us to check on our garden. She had hired a small patch of land for us, and our tomatoes had grown well. This is helpful for those who live in apartment complexes and don't have space for gardening.

## Sports Facilities

The park has excellent sports facilities:
- **Tennis courts** for racket sports
- **Football/soccer fields** with lighting for evening games
- **Baseball diamonds** for America's favorite pastime
- **Basketball courts** for pickup games

## Exercise Areas

There are dedicated exercise areas where adults can work out using outdoor equipment. My dad often uses these facilities while I play on the playground equipment nearby.

## Playground Fun

The children's playground includes:
- üõù **Slides** of different sizes
- üé† **Sit and spin** equipment
- üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Climbing structures**
- ‚ö° **Swings** that I love spending time on

## Nature and Wildlife

The park is home to many beautiful birds and wildlife. Walking along the river, we can observe:
- Ducks swimming peacefully
- Various bird species
- Beautiful trees and plants
- Flowing water from the Sammamish River

## Community Garden

One of the unique features of Marymoor Park is the community garden program. Families can rent small plots of land to grow their own vegetables and flowers. This is especially wonderful for people living in apartments who don't have yard space.

## Family Time

Marymoor Park is the perfect place for family activities:
- Picnicking on the grassy areas
- Flying kites in the open fields
- Walking or biking on the trails
- Playing frisbee or catch

## Dog Off-Leash Area

The park also has a large off-leash dog area where dogs can run freely and play with other dogs. It's always fun to watch the dogs having so much fun!

## Special Events

Throughout the year, Marymoor Park hosts various community events, concerts, and festivals. The amphitheater area is perfect for outdoor concerts during the summer months.
